# CPP-for-Competitive-Programming
A CPP template file to be used for Competitive Programming

## About 📜
A C++ template file to be used for Competitive Programming 💻

It has various functions, macros for many use-cases.

I even added in stdio functions to make it easier too. 

For standard output, I created 2 functions `print()` (to output non-beautified objects) and `printb()` (to output beautified objects)

I also made standard input for iterables easier by replacing boiler plate code with a simple `input()` function.

## Conclusion 🔚
I have just added higher level language (mostly python 🐍) functionalities, to make coding logic for Competitive Programming with C++ easier, rather than using repetitive code chunks.
